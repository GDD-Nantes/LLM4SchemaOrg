From the bedding and the sheets to the mattress, but before you even get there, have you ever thought about what size bed looks most beautiful in a space? Or better yet, which one is most functional in a space? When it comes to bed sizes, the general rule of thumb is the bigger the better. The worst thing you want to do is to end up sleeping on something that isn't right for you. The Sleep Council recommends that the more space you\u2019ve got, the less disturbance you\u2019ll have from your partner, and the much better night\u2019s sleep you\u2019ll have. Most people make a mistake of letting the size of their room determine the size of their bed. The best way to find out the correct size bed for you is to try the beds out. Bring your partner along, lie on the beds, put your hands behind your head, and if you find that your elbows are touching, you\u2019ll need the next size bed. Also, your bed should be at least 10 centimeters longer than the tallest person sleeping in it. This will make sure that you have enough space to get a good night's sleep, without bashing your partner, rolling into them or having your toes dangling out at the end."}
