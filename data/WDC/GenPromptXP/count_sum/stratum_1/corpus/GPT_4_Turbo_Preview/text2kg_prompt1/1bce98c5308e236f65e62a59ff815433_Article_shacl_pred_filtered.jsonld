It was the culmination of years of effort from coaches, players, administrators, and the mighty marketing machine of Nike. Before the 2001 season and Oregon’s BCS game victory over Colorado, the Ducks were known on a national level as simply that kooky school out west with the crazy uniforms. After the game, the Ducks were considered a legitimate football program capable of competing toe-to-toe with any school in the nation.\\n\\nThe Oregon Ducks finished the season ranked #2 in every poll, the highest finish in school history. After Nebraska’s lackluster performance in the national championship game in an embarrassing loss to Miami in the Rose Bowl, many pundits agreed that it SHOULD have been Oregon in the big game not the Cornhuskers.\\n\\nIn the time since, Oregon has expanded Autzen Stadium, built other facilities, earned national respect, and participated in a post-season bowl game all but one year (2004). During that stretch, the Ducks have gone 3-6 in bowls, but that includes three BCS games including the national championship, and are coming off a victory in the Rose Bowl over Wisconsin 45-38, Oregon’s first Rose Bowl victory since 1917.\\n\\nWith the Fiesta Bowl victory in 2002 being such a watershed moment in program history, we have highlighted the lead-up and game itself the last few weeks, and now we close out our series on the Fiesta Bowl with a detailed interview with Justin Phinisee to get the post-game reaction. Justin Phinisee was a redshirt the year Oregon won the Fiesta Bowl, a teammate with the best spectator seat in the house roaming the sidelines eager for his opportunity the following year to carry the torch and expand on the precedent established by the seniors that led Oregon to victory over Colorado."}
