        "articleBody[TOK_Q_DELIM]If we want to list the foods, sweets and drinks in which the saffron is used, it may not be possible. However, a short list of foods, sweets and drinks can be brought. A handful of examples:\n\n1-Use of saffron as a spice in chicken kebab (you may read the recipe [here](http://anasaffron.com/saffron-chicken-kebab/))\n2- Using saffron as a colorant for meat dishes\n3- Using saffron as a coloring and flavoring in brewed rice (like [tah chin](http://anasaffron.com/how-to-make-iranian-saffron-tah-chin/) and [Iranian saffron rice](http://anasaffron.com/iranian-saffron-rice-recipe/))\n4- Using saffron as a coloring and decorating in sweets (like really delicious [desserts](http://anasaffron.com/saffron-dessert-with-rice-milk-with/))\n5- Using saffron as a coloring and flavoring in syrups and beverages\n6- Using saffron petals as a natural food coloring\n7- Using petals to prepare jam (saffron jam)\n8- Using saffron as the most important seasoning of all jams\n\nImagine that there are dozens of examples for each of the above. For example, the people of the southern region of the country of Iran prepare the fish with only salt and vinegar, but when they want to serve a dear and honorable guest, they add a little saffron to it, and just a few saffron stains, suddenly color and gives a different effect to the taste and smell of food.\n\n![saffron foods](http://anasaffron.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/saffronfood1-300x200.jpg)[TOK_Q_DELIM]Article": {
