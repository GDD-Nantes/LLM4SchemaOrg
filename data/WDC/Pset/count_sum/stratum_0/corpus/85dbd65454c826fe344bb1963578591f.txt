Gary Paul Albrecht, 84, of Moline, passed away Saturday, September 3, 2022 at
River Crossing in Moline. A visitation will be Tuesday, October 4, 2022 from
5-7 pm at the Runge Mortuary. His final resting place will be in Davenport
Memorial Park Cemetery. Memorials may go to the family. Online condolences may
be left at rungemortuary.com. Gary was born in Muscatine on June 23, 1938. He
was the son of Clarence and Anna (Brunow) Albrecht. On October 17, 1959 in
Muscatine, he married Maureen C. Bond. She died June 20, 2000. Gary worked as
Chief Tool & Die Engineer for Reynolds Engineering retiring after 50 years of
service. He was a sports enthusiast, especially bowling which he played on the
Rock Island City Bowling League. Having scored a perfect “300”, Gary was most
proud of that achievement! He also loved collecting sports cards and had his
own beer can collection. He also was an avid Iowa Hawkeye and Chicago Cubs
fan. Those left to honor his memory include his daughter, Cynthia, Davenport.
In addition to his wife, he was preceded in death by his parents. He was a
wonderful father and will be greatly missed!
