{"@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/"}, "@type": "Dataset", "name": "ARG Database", "description": "The ARG Database is a huge collection of labeled and unlabeled graphs realized by the MIVIA Group. The aim of this collection is to provide the graph research community with a standard test ground for the benchmarking of graph matching algorithms. The database is organized in two sections: labeled and unlabeled graphs. Both labeled and unlabeled graphs have been randomly generated according to six different generation models, each involving different possible parameter settings. As a result, 168 diverse kinds of graphs are contained in the database. Each type of unlabeled graph is represented by thousands of pairs of graphs for which an isomorphism or a graph-subgraph isomorphism relation holds, for a total of 143,600 graphs. Furthermore, each type of labeled graph is represented by thousands of pairs of graphs holding a not trivial common subgraph, for a total of 166,000 graphs. Some useful information about the dataset, including some usage examples, can be downloaded here.", "url": "https://mivia.unisa.it/datasets/graph-database/arg-database/", "citation": "De Santo, M. et al.
