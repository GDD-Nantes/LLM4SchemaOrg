##### Admissions

**UCC** has a strategic priority and a policy of widening access which has
resulted in almost 25% of the current student population coming from under-
represented areas including Disability Support Service; Mature Students; UCC
Plus+.

The Disability Support Service provides support to over 1,500 students with
disabilities and is a core element of Access and Participation in UCC. The
Service works to increase access and retention of students with disabilities
and specific learning difficulties and does this by delivering a very
proactive and innovative pre-entry programme through which we engage with
primary and secondary schools as well as students with disabilities and their
parents.

UCC is the most successful university in Ireland in providing access to
undergraduate programmes through admission from Further Education colleges
(termed the QQI-FET (FETAC) route) and there is a substantial annual increase
since 2013.

The Mature Student Office (MSO) works with full-time undergraduate students
who are over the age of 23 (on 1 January of the year of entry to the third
level) and with QQI-FET students. In 2018/19 there were 1052 mature students
and QQI-FET students registered in UCC.

The Sanctuary Scholarships Scheme 2018 has successfully filled its seven
undergraduate scholarship offers for asylum seeker students aged between18-23.
Students are engaged in a range of courses awarded through the CAO, across
three Colleges, namely Arts, the College of Arts Celtic Studies and Social
Sciences, the College of Science, Engineering and Food Science and the College
of Medicine and Health.

Nine of this year’s Quercus Talented Student scholarships will be offered to
CAO applicants. At least a further 60 Quercus Entrance scholarships, will be
awarded to incoming students on the basis of their high performance in the
Leaving Certificate examination.

In 2017 based on primary degree graduates 93.7% were in employment or
completing further study such as Masters Degrees. Only 2.8% were seeking
employment which is extremely low while a further 3.5% were not available to
respond.

Again based on 2017/2018 data the 4 year degree total graduation rate is 84%
and the 5 year degree total graduation rate is 93%

UCC has a great record for the retention of first year students. Based on
2017/2018 data this is running at 92%, circa 6% ahead of the National Average.

### Raphael Olympio to perform at Other Voices at UCC

Raphael Olympio, a Cork-based rapper, spoken-word artist and UCC student in
Occupational Therapy, is among the artists set to perform at ‘Other Voices of
UCC’ on Thursday at 5pm.  
  
Born in Lomé, Togo, West Africa during a time of post-civil war, Olympio and
his family fled to Ireland seeking asylum, spending two years in Direct
Provision in Clonakilty.  
  
In his early teenage years, he started composing songs, poems, and spoken word
as he found it easier to speak up about his life experiences through music.
Raphael’s upcoming album ABCD –A Black Child Dilemma is inspired by his own
life story and community.  
  
Now, as a youth worker in both the YMCA and Tribe, he is inspiring the next
generation of Cork’s teens from migrant backgrounds to succeed through music
and education.

  * ![1916 Proclamation donated to UCC](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7nTBGkXlHi8/hqdefault.jpg)

### 1916 Proclamation donated to UCC

University College Cork (UCC) has been generously gifted a first issue copy of
the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic.  
  
This copy of The Proclamation has an impeccable provenance, known to have been
brought directly from the General Post Office (GPO) during Ireland’s 1916
Easter Rising. It has been donated to UCC by Liam and Kaye Cronin.  
  
1,000 copies of The Proclamation were printed at Liberty Hall, Dublin on
Easter Sunday, 1916, and it was read from the steps of the GPO, O’Connell St.,
Dublin on Easter Monday morning by Pádraig Pearse in the presence of the other
signatories of the document, heralding the Easter Rising, and Ireland’s
advance towards self-determination. Very few survive today.  
  
The Proclamation donated to UCC has belonged to Richard Gogan TD. Gogan came
from a strongly republican family, joining the volunteers at the age of 14,
and was reputedly the youngest member of the GPO garrison during the 1916
Rising. He attended to James Connolly after he was wounded, and was one of the
stretcher-bearers for Connolly when the GPO was evacuated. Gogan was later a
founder member of Fianna Fáil, and a TD for Dublin North West from 1954-1977.
He died in 1982. This copy of the Proclamation was his proudest possession and
it is known that he carried it with him personally from the GPO.

##### Student Life

**UCC's** Academic Strategy (2018 - 2022) was launched on 4th December 2018,
following almost a year of development, and sets out a roadmap for our
academic ambitions over the coming years. It focusses on six key areas:

  1. Develop a Connected Curriculum, building on existing strengths and best practice globally.
  2. Align curriculum offerings with demand and with teaching and research priorities.
  3. Constructively align effective assessment practices with learning outcomes.
  4. Facilitate students' development of core values and graduate attributes.
  5. Establish a student enrolment plan that aligns with student recruitment targets.
  6. Reform academic governance such that innovation is enabled, coherence is restored and risk is reduced.

The Connected University programme is a five-year investment programme in our
student and academic services that will create a truly connected university.
This programme of work is informed by the goals and actions of the
university’s strategic plan (2017–2022) and will deliver change and
improvement through a number of individual strands i.e. The Academic Strategy,
Student Central, Student Administration Systems, The Student Hub and the
Virtual Learning Environment. Significant progress has been made in the
programme.

**New Virtual Learning Environment Introduced – Canvas**

Canvas is a cloud-based Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) developed by a
company called Instructure. Canvas is used by some 3,000 institutions
globally, and it has been selected to replace Blackboard as UCC’s VLE for the
2019/20 academic year.

**On 27 February, 2019** , UCC launched a new **Sports Strategy**. The four-
year strategy was launched by Olympic rowing hero Paul O’Donovan and athlete
Mary Fitzgerald, who recently won three gold medals at the 2019 IWAS World
Games. This new strategy aims to develop a new UCC Sports Park in Curraheen to
replace the current facilities at the Farm in Cork – a leading action in the
University Strategic Plan. A new sporting club, ‘Sport for Life Club - Many
Tribes-One Team’, will be launched to connect players, volunteers, sponsors,
supporters and alumni. Other plans include the launch of a new #ActiveUCC
sports participation programme, and an annual UCC Sport Hall of Fame Day.
Also, a new line of UCC Sport Skull and Crossbones-branded apparel will be
developed. With the year only in its second month, it has already been a
phenomenal start for UCC sport. UCC completed the first Sigerson-Fitzgibbon
cup double in 31 years this year, while earlier this year UCC beat UL to take
the Collingwood Cup to clinch their 14th win in the competition. UCC also
extended its partnership earlier this year with Cork City FC.

**Equality Diversion and Inclusion** : UCC launches its first ever Diversity
Calendar for the third level sector in September. Based on submissions from
UCC staff and students, this calendar marks significant religious events,
internationally recognised dates (e.g. relating to civil rights) and national
and local diversity-related events and dates. The calendar is proposed to
create conversations about diverse religious and other events that affect
students' and staff's lives and their engagement with UCC duties and tasks.
UCC is adopting the expanded Athena SWAN Charter Principles, which become
mandatory in Ireland from 2019.

**Autism Friendly University Initiative:** A three year project to create an
academic, social and physical environment that will support autistic students
from the pre-entry stage through to graduation and employment was launched by
the Deputy President and Registrar on July 3rd, 2018. The initiative,
spearheaded by the UCC Students’ Union, is undertaken in collaboration with
AsIAm.ie, the autism support and advocacy organization. The initiative will
deliver a state of the art building in the heart of the campus open to all
students, which will provide an inclusive, quiet space, housing a sensory
room, an eating area, a meditation room as well as accessible and gender
neutral bathrooms.
