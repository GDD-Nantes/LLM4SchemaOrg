  <strong>Title:</strong> Be Careful What You Wish For: FRBR, Some Lacunae, A Review<br />
  <strong>Author:</strong> Smiraglia, Richard P.<br />
  <strong>Subjects:</strong> Catalog ; Works <br />
  <strong>Is Part Of:</strong>
  <div>Cataloging &amp;amp; Classification Quarterly, 2012, Vol. 50 (5),</div>
  <div>p.360-368 [Peer Reviewed Journal]<br />
    <strong>Description:</strong>
      The library catalog as a catalog of works
      was an infectious idea, which together with research led to
      reconceptualization in the form of the FRBR conceptual model. Two
      categories of lacunae emerge—the expression entity, and gaps in the
      model such as aggregates and dynamic documents. Evidence needed to
      extend the FRBR model is available in contemporary research on
      instantiation. The challenge for the bibliographic community is to
      begin to think of FRBR as a form of knowledge organization system,
      adding a final dimension to classification. The articles in the present
      special issue offer a compendium of the promise of the FRBR
      model.

# Commercial Loan for Small Business

![Commercial Loan for Small
Business](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1024'%20height='328'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20328'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Commercial
Loan for Small Business](https://www.lendingkart.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/08/Commercial-Loans-for-Small-Business-1024x328.png)  
Let’s start with the basics.

## So, What Exactly is a Commercial Loan?

A loan provided to a business by a financial institution such as a bank or a
lending company is known as a commercial loan. It is used to cover capital
expenses or operational costs, which the company otherwise wouldn’t be able to
afford.

Due to high upfront costs and some regulatory hurdles, small businesses are
often prevented from having direct access to equity and bond markets for
financing. This often leaves smaller businesses to rely on lending products
such as unsecured loans, a line of credit, or term loans.

## Why the need for Commercial Loans?

  *  ** _Expansion_**

Small businesses who have already built a strong footing in the market can now
move on to the next stage, which is an expansion of the business. With an
established business model and good transactional history in place, one can
utilise a commercial loan to expand the business. Small business owners can
also look at the possibility of expanding across geographical locations or a
new target audience.

  *  _ **Equipment and tools** _

Science and technology are changing every day. The quality, overall output and
productivity of a business can be enhanced greatly with the newer technologies
and tools. Small business owners can take advantage of commercial loans to
invest in new technology that would give them a competitive advantage.

Business](https://www.lendingkart.com/blog/machinery-loan-without-security/)

  *  _ **Inventory management** _

Sometimes, small business owners hesitate to take up big orders. Big orders
mean having enough raw materials which are available in a ready-to-use state.
Commercial loans can come in handy here. Small business owners can avail of
commercial loans to buy the necessary inventory much ahead of time.

  *  _ **Increase working capital** _

The cornerstone of any successful business be it micro, small, medium or large
is to have healthy [working capital](https://www.lendingkart.com/working-
capital-loan/). It is critical for a business to have healthy working capital
to survive. Unforeseen payment delays by customers can be avoided if a
commercial loan is availed to balance out the adverse financial implications.

  *  ** _Consolidate Debts_**

Small business owners can consolidate all their smaller debts into one single
EMI. This not just reduces the strain on your monthly budget but also helps in
keeping track of your debts. There is also an option to expand your repayment
schedule for up to 12 months, which means that the chances of you reducing
your monthly EMI amount are high.

## How do I know if I am Eligible for a Commercial Loan?

If you can fulfil all the below
[requirements](https://www.lendingkart.com/business-loans/eligibility-and-
requirements/), you are all prepared to apply for a commercial loan.

  * The business must be in operations for more than six
  * The minimum turnover of Rs. 90,000 or more should be fulfilled three months before submitting your loan application.
  * The business should not be in the list of negative location.
  * The only businesses that are not eligible for commercial loans are trusts, NGOs and charitable institutions.

Contact us in case your business falls under the restricted category or
location, to confirm if you are eligible.

## What all documentation would you need to submit while applying for a
commercial loan?

commercial loan. We, at Lendingkart, believe in sticking to the bare
