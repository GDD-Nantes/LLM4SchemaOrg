The right\nfaucet will have openings that align with those already in your sink or\ncounter, so that the faucet you purchase will appropriately fit in the space\nleft behind by your old faucet. Faucets typically have between 1 and 4 holes\nto fit the different options in your sink or counter, and the number of sink\naccessories - like sprayers and soap dispensers - in your sink setup. Make\nsure you purchase a faucet with the number of spaces that fits your space and\nyour needs to help make sure your faucet installation goes without a hitch.", "provider": {"@type": "LocalBusiness", "name": "HERITAGE P.P.
