  <strong>Title:</strong> Be Careful What You Wish For: FRBR, Some Lacunae, A Review<br />
  <strong>Author:</strong> Smiraglia, Richard P.<br />
  <strong>Subjects:</strong> Catalog ; Works <br />
  <strong>Is Part Of:</strong>
  <div>Cataloging &amp;amp; Classification Quarterly, 2012, Vol. 50 (5),</div>
  <div>p.360-368 [Peer Reviewed Journal]<br />
    <strong>Description:</strong>
      The library catalog as a catalog of works
      was an infectious idea, which together with research led to
      reconceptualization in the form of the FRBR conceptual model. Two
      categories of lacunae emerge—the expression entity, and gaps in the
      model such as aggregates and dynamic documents. Evidence needed to
      extend the FRBR model is available in contemporary research on
      instantiation. The challenge for the bibliographic community is to
      begin to think of FRBR as a form of knowledge organization system,
      adding a final dimension to classification. The articles in the present
      special issue offer a compendium of the promise of the FRBR
      model.

# Trojan Tantrums to Conerly Decision Announce Dan Lanning on the Recruiting
Stage

A dilemma for many of us diehard fans of _**Our Beloved Ducks**_ , is that
progressing further into _**“Greybeard-age**_ ” does not always mean we become
more noble human beings…especially when it comes to victories over the Trojans
of USC. Due to our experiences in dealing with SC fans so much longer than
most, we have developed reactions over the years that are _less_ than
honorable, and yet we do not feel the least bit guilty about it.

I was checking out the level of safety and security of my favorite gambling
sites being reviewed on
[_**https://esportsbetting.com/**_](https://esportsbetting.com/) when the
**Josh Conerly** **Jr.** announcement surprised me, and yet made me laugh in
advance of _actually seeing_ how the fans of USC would react. They did not
disappoint, and while this site and our sister site, [_**the OBD
Forum**_](https://forum.fishduck.com/) love to discuss Oregon football, Trojan
tantrums provide _**superb entertainment**_ on an off-season Saturday.

#### _**Shock and Awed:**_

_“There is **no way** he chose Oregon without the NIL deal of the century. If
MC was still head coach I would totally get it but this makes **no** sense.”_

_“A position of need is what makes this **a tough one**.”_

_“He would have been a major difference maker for us. **Huge loss**. No way
around it.”_

_“We’re still recruiting the offensive line like we’re a mid-major program.
**This is embarrassing**.”_

USC-2020-UO-Athletics.jpg)

University of Oregon Athletics

This WAS a huge position of need for USC…

#### Trojan Fans Turning on Their Coaches?

_“You ask who cares? This was a massive need and we just lost him to the team
who presents the biggest competition to us. Lincoln got complacent and got
schooled by a program with superior recruiters. Seriously, who the heck
chooses Eugene over USC when the opportunity to start day one was staring him
in the face?”_

_“The sky isn’t falling but trying to down-play this after the level of hubris
I’ve seen on this Trojan board is hilarious. We got our a**es handed to us at
a position of need. I trust our coach but he just got his tail whipped.”_

_“How do you let a guy like that out of your grasp at inarguably the biggest
hole on the roster? We KNEW Oregon was pulling out the stops last weekend and
clearly didn’t do enough to fix it. That’s on us; no excuses.”_

_“Oregon has beat us for every offensive line target we have gone head to head
for in recent years.”

#### _**New-Found Respect for Oregon Coaches:**_

_“The track record of Oregon coaches Adrian Klemm and Tosh Lupoi to get 5-star
recruits would indicate these kinds of wins are going to be more common than
we hope. Coach Riley needs to respond and just do better, as this is not
acceptable.”_

_“Give Lanning credit. He went for the ace recruiters and it’s already paying
off. This is a massive, massive loss by Riley and the guy should’ve
prioritized recruiting chops, rather than let the biggest competition in the
Pac-12 get these guys.”_

_“This was something I worried about from the beginning. Klemm is obviously a
great recruiter and has put several guys in the league and just came from the
league but I always worried about the connection he had with JC on a personal
level.”_

#### _**Who is Number One in the Pac-12?**_

_“We (USC) will have the number one recruiting class this cycle, and Oregon
will be 6-6 in 2022.”_

There is considerable confusion about this, and I refer to the standings at
_**Rivals.com**_ , and I explain why [_**here**_](https://fishduck.com/why-i-
use-rivals-com-over-247-for-recruiting-comparisons/) , as they are the only
site to offer accurate historical reference. You can see[ _ **right
here**_](https://n.rivals.com/team_rankings/2022/all-teams/football) , that
Stanford is the leader for the 2022 recruiting class in the conference coming
in at **No. 24** , while Oregon is **No. 33** and USC is **No. 59**. As for
2023? USC has a big lead, but it is a _long_ _time_ before the December and
February signing dates.

Adrian Klemm just rocked the Pac-12 world…

#### _**My Favorite Quote?**_

_“I mean, how do you come in saying you’re going to demand excellence and lose
a guy like Conerly to Oregon? When you have a massive need with immediate
playing time at left tackle???? It’s unfathomable. **This is equivalent to
having a 10 point lead with 60 seconds left and losing the game**.”_

My _**FishDuck Friends**_ , their astonishment matches that of Oregon
fans–only in opposite directions. However the reactions of both Trojans and
Ducks indicates that fans of _**all**_ schools in the Pac-12 have yet to
realize the full impact of the hiring of **Dan Lanning** at Oregon. It is
another example of…

_“Oh, how we love to ponder about **Our Beloved Ducks**!”_
