        "articleBody[TOK_Q_DELIM]It's hard to beat Pinterest for popular haircut inspiration. And while scrolling through inspo photos rarely translates to the exact style on your head, it never hurts to look (even if that just turns into a mountain of photos to bring in to your next haircut). The only question is, which to narrow down as your first pick—and for anyone who's ever struggled with that Q, we've got good news. In a very helpful move, Pinterest just revealed the number one most popular haircut on the platform right now. Listen closely: That's the sound of a million inspo boards updating. With over 80,000 pins, the tousled lob is the coolest way to go short—and despite the name, it's actually a new, super-interesting-looking technique. Per Kerastase celebrity hairstylist Matt Fugate, you just ask for a 'shattered' lob, with layers not cut in a straight line but chipped into with a razor. It's more layered and deconstructed than the one on every celebrity, like a shag without the facial framing.[TOK_Q_DELIM]NewsArticle": {
