# Advanced Lens Implants

## Customized IOLs

At nJoy Vision, various basic and premium Advanced Lens Implants or
Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) are offered that can be customized to suit your
specific condition and lifestyle. These options treat different types of
vision problems and our [board-certified eye
surgeons](https://www.njoyvision.com/about-us/providers/) can help determine
the IOL that's right for you.

### Light Adjustable Lens

The **RxSight™ Light Adjustable Lens** is the first and only intraocular lens
(IOL) that can be customized _after_ surgery. The Light Adjustable Lens is
made of a special photosensitive material that can be adjusted in response to
ultraviolet (UV) light. This optimization is done by your eye doctor in the
weeks following lens implantation through a series of non-invasive light
treatments that take only a few minutes each. You will have the unique ability
to adjust and preview your vision until it meets your personal desires and
lifestyle requirements. The Light Adjustable Lens delivers superior visual
outcomes that non-adjustable lenses simply cannot match.  Imagine being able
to test-drive your vision after surgery and having the ability to tailor your
vision to your exact needs—that’s now possible with the Light Adjustable Lens.

### Multifocal IOL

Multifocal IOLs provide both distance and near focus at the same time. The
lens has different zones set at different powers and is designed so that your
brain learns to select the right focus automatically. With multiple points of
focus, one image is in focus at a time.

The **AcrySof ® IQ PanOptix®** Trifocal IOL is the first in the United States
that has the ability to provide enhanced vision for distance, intermediate and
near.  It is a type of multifocal IOL used to focus images clearly onto the
back of your eye (retina) to allow clear vision after the cataract removal. In
addition, the center of the **AcrySof ® IQ PanOptix®** Trifocal IOL allows for
better near (reading) vision and intermediate (computer work) vision versus
what a monofocal lens would provide.

The  **TECNIS ®** Multifocal IOL is optimized for those favoring intermediate
and near vision activities like grocery shopping and reading or sewing.  It
delivers tailored clarity at a theoretical reading distance of 50 cm.  The **
TECNIS®** Multifocal Family of IOLs features multifocal lenses capable of
providing a full range of high-quality vision tailored for each patient’s
lifestyle with sharp vision across near, intermediate and distance vision.

**AcrySof** ® **Toric IQ**  (Alcon) and **TECNIS ® Toric II** (J&J) are a
couple of several brands of toric IOLs available that treat astigmatism as
part of an RLE.  Your surgeon will select the lens for your eyes based on the
examination measurements.  Over 125 million **AcrySof ®** Lenses have been
implanted and counting.

[View Video](http://fyi.rendia.com/IojIE)

### Advanced Technology Extended Depth of Focus IOL

The **TECNIS Symfony®** Extended Depth of Focus IOL is a breakthrough for RLE
procedures. The **TECNIS Symfony®** lens is the first IOL available to correct
for presbyopia that provides a continuous full range of high-quality vision.
These lenses allow you to see clearly at near, intermediate and far distances
and also minimize side effects associated with multifocal IOLs like glares and
halos around lights.

The **AcrySof® IQ Vivity™** Extended Vision IOL is a type of IOL used to focus
images clearly onto the back of your eye (retina) to allow clear vision after
the cataract removal. The **AcrySof® IQ Vivity™** Extended Vision IOL provides
clear distance vision (e.g., for watching children playing in the backyard).
In addition, the **AcrySof® IQ Vivity™** Extended Vision IOL allows for better
intermediate (working on a computer, applying makeup or shaving) and some near
(reading, knitting) vision compared to what a monofocal IOL would provide. The
**AcrySof® IQ Vivity™ IOL** is not a multifocal IOL, as it uses a new
Wavefront-Shaping technology to provide the broader range of vision.

### Accommodating IOL

**Crystalens®  AO** Lens is an artificial lens implant that can treat both a
person's cataracts and presbyopia —the clouding or hardening of your lenses,
and the loss of near and intermediate vision, respectively. Crystalens was
modeled after the human eye. Like the natural lens, it is a lens implant that
uses the eye muscle to flex and accommodate in order to focus on objects in
the environment at all distances. Crystalens dynamically adjusts to your
visual needs. Many patients will have greater freedom from glasses after
surgery, but you may still need reading glasses for small print or other near
vision tasks.  The **Crystalens®  AO** Lens may have less halos and glare when
compared to multifocal IOL options.

### Toric IOL for astigmatism

Basic lens implants are not able to adjust for astigmatism (an imperfection in
the curvature of your cornea) which may also be affecting your vision. Toric
IOLs are able to correct for astigmatism and, therefore, give you a better
chance of good distance vision without glasses or contacts after your surgery.

[View Video](http://fyi.rendia.com/lGx7S)

### Basic Monofocal IOL

Monofocal IOLs are basic artificial lenses that have one focusing distance.
Your choice depends on what type of vision is most important to you—up close
(reading), medium range (computer screen), or distance vision (driving). A
monofocal IOL that results in clear distance vision can be supplemented by
wearing glasses for reading and other close-range needs.

There are many available monofocal IOLs, including the new **TECNIS Eyhance™**
IOL that defies conventional thinking about monofocal IOLs by delivering not
only high-quality distance vision, but also better low-light image contrast.
