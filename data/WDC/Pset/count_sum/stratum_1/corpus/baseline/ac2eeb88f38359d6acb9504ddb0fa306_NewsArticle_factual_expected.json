        "articleBody[TOK_Q_DELIM]It's hard to beat Pinterest for popular haircut inspiration. And while  scrolling through inspo photos rarely translates to the exact style [on your head](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/best-summer-haircuts-for-every-length-and-texture), it never hurts to look (even if that just turns into a mountain of photos to bring in to your next haircut). The only question is, which to narrow down as your first pick—and for anyone who's ever struggled with that Q, we've got good news. In a *very* helpful move, Pinterest just revealed the number one most popular haircut on the platform right now. Listen closely: That's the sound of a million inspo boards updating.\n\nWith over 80,000 pins, the tousled lob is the coolest way to go short—and despite the name, it's actually a new, super-interesting-looking technique. Per Kerastase celebrity hairstylist [Matt Fugate](https://www.instagram.com/mattshair/?hl=en), you just ask for a \"shattered\" lob, with layers not cut in a straight line but chipped into with a razor. It's more layered and deconstructed than the one on [every celebrity](https://www.glamour.com/story/selena-gomez-swooped-bangs), like [a shag](https://www.glamour.com/story/bella-hadid-bob-haircut) without the facial framing.\n\n[#pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/345229127669103527/]\n\n\"The cut is super layered, but don’t say *layered,*\" he says. That might set your hairstylist down the wrong path, with all the layers falling in the same place (not what you want). Instead, ask for lots of texture with light, airy, razor-cut ends. And if you want to recreate this exact photo—no shade, it's glorious—Fugate says to save your highlights for after the cut. Otherwise your stylist will end up cutting a ton out, which is a horrible thought (bye, money). For the 'lights themselves, have your colorist lift the \"shattered\" pieces and paint on the ends. \n\nThe only downside is that this cut really shines on straight and wavy hair but doesn't work quite as well on curls and kinks. You can do it if you want (do anything, if you want!), but Fugate warns that it'll take serious maintenance to stay with the pin's look. And if you're not about the heat styling, the shattered tactic will leave curly ends tattered, [with frizz aplenty](https://www.glamour.com/story/frizzy-hair-is-beautiful). Otherwise, get thee—with this photo—to the salon.\n\n__Related Stories:__     \n-[Frederic Fekkai Just Released a New Hair Line, and We're Hoarding All of It](https://www.glamour.com/story/frederic-fekkai-the-one)      \n-[This Is the Secret to Making Dark Roots Look Intentional](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-to-pull-off-dark-roots)     \n-[The Best Instagram Accounts for Curly Haircut Inspiration](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/curly-haircut-inspiration-instagram)[TOK_Q_DELIM]NewsArticle": {
