Now my sister had developed Bladder cancer and I wish he was still in Buffalo. Just to check---My mothers name is/was Mary Laskowski. He installed a bag for her Urine. God Bless him and I can hope That this is the right Doctor.

To make a long story short I ended up having a TERP operation performed by Dr. V. He is an excellent surgeon and communicator. I experience zero pain from the operation and the operation was very successful. He took the time to answer all my questions and I came in with a list. I just don't think you could find a better Doctor/Surgeon. He returned my quality of life."}, {"@type": "Review", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"}, "author": "Mary in Ft Wayne, IN", "datePublished": "2017-07-12", "reviewBody": "Dr. Velagapudi has doctored my sister, mother-in-law, son, husband, nephew and me.

He has been caring for my husband for over 4 years. He discusses things with you and never leaves you guessing or wondering what's going to happen or what is going to take place. He even looked up Tony's CT Scan and went over that with us, SINCE HIS MEDICAL DOCTOR never went over it with us. He is sooo good.
