## Business Needs

The client wanted to develop an app that uses a digital money transfer
solution within Africa. The main need for this money transfer service was to
operate a decentralized platform that would work without a central authority.
It is also a permanent solution for easy money transfer/exchange via mobile
phone with full security.

## How It Works

To execute our vision, we will offer innovative payment solutions with
increased convenience, better exchange rates and provide an exceptional
overall service with no hidden fees and charges. We will continue to leverage
technology and welcome ideas that enhance our product offering to ensure that
our customers and clients receive greater savings and continuous exceptional
service.

  * PayAngel has made sending money to Ghana and Africa easy
  * Sign up in a minute with our simple registration process, your email address and phone number are all you need to start.
  * One Touch Money Transfer with 3D Secure Payment
  * Instant Money Transfer to Bank Account
  * Cash Collection Facility

The biggest challenge was to implement Instant money transfer with the latest
exchange rate. Was difficult to implement 3D Secure Payment in Mobile App.

with the Google+ Hangouts API. We came to them because of their willingness to
get up to speed on the APIs very quickly, and also because of their convenient
timezone with relation to Tokyo, where our team was
based.![](https://www.rlogical.com/wp-

## Involvement

Led by the Rlogical Offshore team, all individual modules in the project were
delivered on time and ready to be integrated into the system. A structured
project process has been implemented and the team is ready to challenge status
to simplify the reorganization process. The direction decision was made more
quickly and there was a clear accountability to ensure that the work was
completed as planned.
