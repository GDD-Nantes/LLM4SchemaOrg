 **Returns**

 **Distance Selling Regulations  **  
  
Online, mail and telephone order customers have the right to cancel their
order for a limited time even if the goods aren't faulty. We will offer a
refund to customers if you have notified us in writing within 14 days of
receipt that you wish to cancel your order. Cancelled goods must be returned
to Groomers Limited within a further 14 days after we have been notified. We
will refund customers within 14 days of receiving the goods back.

No reason for return is required.

Please note that you will be responsible for the cost of returning the goods
to us unless we delivered the item to you in error or the item is faulty.

Your unwanted item must be in a re-saleable condition and in the original,
undamaged, unopened product packaging with any labels still attached.

We recommend you keep the original packaging and wrap the return item well to
avoid damage in transit. Please remember the packaging of the item is the
responsibility of the sender, not the courier and Groomers Limited. We reserve
the right to deduct a percentage of the refund or credit if an item is
received unsuitable for re-sale as new. This will be assessed once the product
is received.

If you are returning a large item such as a table, bath or cabinet, the item
will need to be packaged safely on a pallet, this will be required by the
courier for collection and return. If payment is required the cost is from
£45.00 per pallet.

Please be aware that the following items are non-returnable:

  * Goods made to order
  * Sealed media such as DVDs and CDs
  * Gift vouchers

Any returns or exchanges on items purchased at events or shows will attract a
standard delivery charge.

Please remember to include a Groomers Return Form which you can download from
our website or, if you prefer, a covering letter including your full name,
address and contact telephone number so we know who the package is from. We
will need to contact you to arrange payment or a refund.

Although this is a rare occurrence, we highly recommend using recorded post so
that you can track your package should it go astray.

Returns should be mailed to:

Returns, Groomers Limited, 137 Greenham Business Park, Newbury, RG19 6HN

 **  
**

 **Refunds**

We will aim to refund all items within 24 hours of receipt (subject to our
returns policy).

Please allow 3-5 working days for the payment to reach your debit or credit
card as standard. We can only refund any amount due on the card used for
original payment.

 **  
**

 **Returning Small Items by Royal Mail**  
  
If you are returning a small item by post (packet), please ensure the item is
unused, and in its original, undamaged packaging. We will need to resell the
item so please ensure it is returned in the way that you would like to receive
it. To avoid damages in transit, please wrap the item well, preferably in
bubble wrap, and then use a strong box or jiffy bag to send the item. Don't
forget to include your Groomers Returns Form or a covering letter including
your full address and telephone number so that we know who the package is
from. We also recommend recorded post so that you can track your package,
should it go astray.

 **Returning Large Items by Postal Service or Courier:  **  
  
If you are returning a large item (2kg+) for a refund or credit note, please
ensure the item is unused, and in its original, undamaged packaging. We will
need to resell the item so please ensure it is returned in the way that you
would like to receive it. If the item is sold in an item specific box- e.g.
dog cage, please ensure that no address labels or sender details are stuck
onto this box. Please put the item in an outer box or wrap in black
plastic/cellophane for stamps or courier labels. Please remember that packing
an item for return is the responsibility of the sender, not of the courier.
The item will need to reach us undamaged for us to be able to give you a full
refund or exchange, so please package well for transit. Don't forget to
include your Groomers Returns Form or a covering letter including your full
address and telephone number so that we know who the package is from. Again,
we also recommend using recorded post or courier service so that you can track
your package, should it go astray.

purchaser.
