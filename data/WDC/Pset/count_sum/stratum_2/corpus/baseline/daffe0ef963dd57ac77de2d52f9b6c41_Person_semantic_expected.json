        "description[TOK_Q_DELIM]I have previously worked in so many places where I have grown and learned different skills, lessons, approaches, and grew as a person! My mental health work began as a direct staff in a group home with individuals who had developmental disabilities as well as co-morbid mental health diagnoses, where I provided behavioral plans and expectations, structures, socialization skills, and monitored medication adherence. After this, I began working as a case manager at a local mental health agency where I applied the counseling and de-escalation skills I was learning, assisted in accessing and applying for local resources that provide stability, teaching my individuals life and socialization skills to support themselves and increase their support system and helping my individuals maintain stability both on a team that was for those who have difficulty maintaining engagement with their services and then for those first entering the agency. Once I was licensed, I transitioned to a hospital and jail liaison diagnostician, where I coordinated with local hospitals and justice centers in completing intake assessments as well as coordinating follow up and treatment plans with each individual so that they could access services upon leaving & reduce recidivism in the community; I also treated my own counseling clients via the agency at this time. I have been working with the Justice Center for over a year now as a mental health professional, where we provide counseling individuals on a crisis and brief solution basis (more often than not, this includes suicide risk assessment/placement on suicide watch, de-escalation, death notification & processing, and similar items) as well as see them on rounds every day. I complete assessments with identified diagnoses & have some care management roles in helping refer and coordinate with local services to stabilize them in the community prior to release. I also volunteer at Mental Health America as a pro-bono counselor in a variety of counseling services for those who are un- or under-insured to obtain supervision hours & maintain my long-term counseling skills. I am currently pursuing my LPCC and further growth in many areas![TOK_Q_DELIM]Person": {
