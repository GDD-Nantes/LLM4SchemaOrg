This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls \"edits\". See [[editEIDR]].\n\nSince schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.",
