Name: Bodegas Protos Description: Protos means “first” in Greek, and since
1927 this centenary winery has embarked on the mission to be number one. This
attitude has driven their search for constant improvement. The new facilities
designed by prestigious architect and winner of the Priztker Award, Sir
Richard Rogers, once again took the winery to the forefront of wine tourism. A
tour around Protos includes a detailed visit to both the underground cellar
dug into the hillside of Peñafiel Castle and to the winery designed by
celebrated architect Sir Richard Rogers. After completing the itinerary,
visitors can taste 2 excellent Protos wines and will receive a gift. The visit
lasts 1.5 hours (including the sampling). Opening Hours: Monday to Friday,
10:00-13:00 and 16:30-18:00 Address: C/ Bodegas Protos, 24-28, 47300 -
