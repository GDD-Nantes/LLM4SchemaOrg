The document pertains to a movie that is accessible in both auditory and visual modes. This means that the movie can be enjoyed by individuals who rely on hearing or sight to understand the content. 

The movie also includes certain accessibility features to enhance the viewing experience for individuals with specific needs. These features include audio descriptions and captions. Audio descriptions provide additional narration for those who might not be able to see the visual content, describing important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone. On the other hand, captions provide a text version of the spoken part of the media for those who might not be able to hear the audio.

The movie also provides sufficient access modes for different types of audiences. One of these modes combines textual and visual elements, which is particularly useful for those who rely on closed captioning. Another mode is purely auditory, which is beneficial for those who rely on audio descriptions.

The movie also provides an accessibility summary. According to this summary, captions are provided in English. However, for short scenes in French, English subtitles are provided instead. This ensures that non-French speaking audiences can understand the content of these scenes.
