**Change a Flat Tire**

About $20

About 30 minutes

Necessary Items:

Spare tire

Lug wrench

Jack

Wheel wedges

Flares

Preparation

Turn on your hazard lights and set the flares.

You're going to need space and want to be visible.

Position your wheel wedges in front of the front tires if a rear tire is flat,
or behind the rear tires if a front tire is flat.

You don't want the car to move while you're working on it.

Raise the car

![image showing positioning of jack](position-jack.jpg) Position the jack
underneath the car, next to the flat tire.

jack until the flat tire is just barely off of the ground. ![image showing car

It doesn't need to be too high.

Remove the hubcap and loosen the lug nuts.

Remove the flat tire and put the spare tire on the exposed lug bolts.

Tighten the lug nuts by hand.

Don't use the wrench just yet.

Finishing up

Lower the jack and tighten the lug nuts with the wrench.

Replace the hubcap.

Put the equipment and the flat tire away.
