The document pertains to a movie that is accessible in both auditory and visual modes. This means that the movie can be experienced through hearing and seeing. The movie also includes certain accessibility features such as audio description and captions. 

The audio description is a narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone. This feature is especially beneficial for individuals who are blind or have low vision.

Closed captioning displays the audio portion of a television program as text on the TV screen, providing a critical link to news, entertainment, and information for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. 

Another sufficient access mode is the auditory mode, which is described as audio description. 

Lastly, the movie provides captions in English. However, for short scenes that are in French, English subtitles are provided instead. This accessibility summary ensures that non-English speaking scenes are also accessible to the audience.
