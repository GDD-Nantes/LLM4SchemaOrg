For orders processed after cutoff time, one day gets added to the delivery time estimate. This property is expected to be most typically used via the [[ShippingRateSettings]] publication pattern. The time is indicated using the ISO-8601 Time format, e.g. \"23:30:00-05:00\" would represent 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).",
