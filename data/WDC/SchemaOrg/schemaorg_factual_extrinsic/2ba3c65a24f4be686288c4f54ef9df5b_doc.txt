On March 30, 2020, the Example Administration announced a new initiative aimed at supporting small businesses during the ongoing Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. This initiative, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, is designed to provide financial assistance to small businesses, helping them to maintain their workforce during these challenging times. The program is a government-backed loan that offers crucial support to small businesses, ensuring they can continue to operate and pay their employees despite the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.

The Paycheck Protection Program is administered by the US Small Business Administration, a government organization dedicated to supporting small businesses across the United States. The program is categorized under business support services, highlighting its role in providing essential financial aid to small businesses. The program specifically targets small businesses, recognizing their vital role in the economy and the unique challenges they face during the pandemic.

The announcement of this program was made on March 30, 2020, and the program was set to expire on April 24, 2020, at 11:59 PM. This timeframe provided a limited window for small businesses to apply for the financial assistance offered by the program. The program's spatial coverage is limited to the United States, ensuring that the benefits are directed towards supporting the domestic economy.
