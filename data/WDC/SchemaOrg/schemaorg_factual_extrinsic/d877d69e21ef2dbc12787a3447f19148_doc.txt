The provided JSON-LD markup describes a movie with specific accessibility features and modes. This movie is designed to be accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with auditory and visual needs. 

The movie supports two primary access modes: auditory and visual. This means that the content is available in both sound and visual formats, catering to audiences who rely on either or both of these senses to experience the film.

To enhance accessibility, the movie includes several features. It offers audio descriptions, which provide a spoken narration of key visual elements, making the film more accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision. Additionally, the movie includes captions, which are text versions of the spoken dialogue and other relevant sounds, aiding those who are deaf or hard of hearing.

The access modes sufficient for enjoying the movie are detailed in two item lists. The first list indicates that a combination of textual and visual elements is sufficient, as described by the closed captioning feature. This ensures that viewers who can read text and see visuals can fully understand the movie. The second list specifies that auditory access alone is sufficient, thanks to the audio description feature, allowing those who rely on sound to follow the film's narrative.

Furthermore, the accessibility summary provides additional context. It notes that captions are provided in English, ensuring that English-speaking audiences can follow the dialogue and sound effects. For scenes that are in French, English subtitles are provided instead, allowing non-French speakers to understand the content of these scenes.

Overall, this movie is thoughtfully designed to be inclusive, ensuring that individuals with different accessibility needs can enjoy the film through various supportive features.
