The movie's accessibility is further detailed through two sufficient access modes. The first mode is a combination of textual and visual elements, described as "Closed captioning." This mode ensures that viewers can follow the movie through on-screen text that complements the visual content. The second mode is auditory, described as "Audio description," which allows viewers to understand the movie through sound alone.

Additionally, the accessibility summary provides further insight into the language support offered by the movie. Captions are provided in English, ensuring that English-speaking audiences can fully comprehend the dialogue and audio cues. For scenes that are in French, English subtitles are provided instead, allowing non-French speakers to understand the content without missing any crucial information.
