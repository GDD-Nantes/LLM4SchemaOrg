The job posting is for the position of a Software Engineer. This role is a professional opportunity for individuals who are skilled in software development and engineering. The position requires candidates to have a certain level of educational and experiential qualifications to be considered eligible.

In terms of educational requirements, the job specifies that candidates should possess a bachelor's degree.
