The provided JSON-LD markup describes a movie with specific accessibility features and modes. This movie is designed to be accessible to a wide range of audiences, including those with auditory and visual needs. 

The movie supports two primary access modes: auditory and visual. This means that the content is available in both sound and visual formats, catering to audiences who rely on either or both of these senses to experience the film.

To enhance accessibility, the movie includes several features. It offers audio descriptions, which provide a spoken narration of key visual elements in the film, making it more accessible to individuals who are blind or have low vision. Additionally, the movie includes captions, which are text versions of the spoken dialogue and other relevant audio information, such as sound effects and music cues. These captions are particularly beneficial for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.

The movie's accessibility is further detailed through the "accessModeSufficient" property, which outlines the sufficient modes of access for different audiences. One item list specifies that the combination of textual and visual elements, described as "Closed captioning," is sufficient for viewers who rely on these modes. Another item list indicates that the auditory mode, described as "Audio description," is sufficient for those who depend on auditory information.

Moreover, the accessibility summary provides additional context about the language support in the film. It notes that captions are provided in English, ensuring that English-speaking audiences can follow the dialogue and audio cues. For scenes that are in French, English subtitles are provided instead, allowing non-French speakers to understand the content of these scenes.

Overall, this movie is thoughtfully designed to be inclusive and accessible, ensuring that audiences with different needs can enjoy the film with the necessary accommodations.
