It tells the story of a girl named\nAlice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar\nand anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's\nfriends. The tale plays with logic in ways that have given the story lasting\npopularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the\nbest examples of the \"literary nonsense\" genre, and its narrative course and\nstructure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.\n(Introduction by Wikipedia)\n\nUnabridged\n\nFormat: M4B audiobook (video/mp4)\n\nRead by: Eric Leach\n\nRequires an M4B compatible player\n\n[Listen online and download other formats at\narchive.org.](https://archive.org/details/alices_adventures_1005_librivox)\n\n",

It tells the story of a girl named\nAlice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar\nand anthropomorphic creatures. The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's\nfriends. The tale plays with logic in ways that have given the story lasting\npopularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the\nbest examples of the \"literary nonsense\" genre, and its narrative course and\nstructure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.\n(Introduction by Wikipedia)\n\nUnabridged\n\nFormat: M4B audiobook (video/mp4)\n\nRead by: Eric Leach\n\nRequires an M4B compatible player\n\n[Listen online and download other formats at\narchive.org.](https://archive.org/details/alices_adventures_1005_librivox)\n\n",

    "value": "The Cockpit pub marks the approximate site of Shakespeare’s gatehouse. On 10 March 1613, Shakespeare bought the old priory gatehouse from Henry Walker, ‘citizen and minstrel (musician)’ for £140. It was later bought at an auction in 1843 by the City of London Corporation for £145. The deed of purchase for the property still exists today and is housed at the London Metropolitan Archives; it contains one of only six “authenticated” examples of Shakespeare’s signature. The property is particularly significant because – although Shakespeare owned property in Stratford – it is the only property he is known to have owned in London. Given its convenient proximity to the Blackfriars Playhouse and The Globe, Shakespeare may have intended to make it his home, yet no evidence suggests he lived here in the four years prior to his death in 1616.",

Richard Burbage formed a syndicate with Shakespeare, Henry Condell and John Heminge, among others, and together they purchased the playhouse in 1608; yet, due to the outbreak of plague, the opening was delayed until the winter of 1609. It is widely believed that The Winter’s Tale and Cymbeline were written with the Blackfriars Playhouse in mind, despite the fact both plays were also performed at The Globe theatre. The final show at Blackfriars Playhouse was performed in 1642, before it was pulled down in 1655.",

The broadcast frequency specification is a crucial aspect of any broadcast service as it determines the specific electromagnetic wave frequency on which the service transmits its signal. In the case of WXKS-FM, this frequency is 107.9.\n\nFurthermore, the broadcast signal modulation used by WXKS-FM is FM, or Frequency Modulation. This is a method of impressing data onto an alternating-current (AC) wave by varying the instantaneous frequency of the wave. This method is commonly used for broadcasting music and speech, mobile communications, and satellite television broadcasting. \n\nIn conclusion, WXKS-FM, also known as \"Kiss 108\", is a broadcast service that operates on a frequency of 107.9 using FM signal modulation.",
