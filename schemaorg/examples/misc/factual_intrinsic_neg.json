UIA is a Microsoft accessibility framework that provides programmatic access to most user interface elements on the desktop, enhancing the accessibility of applications.\n\nFinally, the Creative Work offers comprehensive accessibility controls, including \"fullKeyboardControl,\" \"fullTouchControl,\" \"fullVoiceControl,\" and \"fullMouseControl.\" These controls ensure that users can interact with the work using a variety of input methods, catering to individuals with different preferences and needs. Full keyboard control allows users to navigate and interact with the work using only a keyboard, which is essential for those who cannot use a mouse. Full touch control ensures compatibility with touch-screen devices, while full voice control allows users to operate the work using voice commands. Full mouse control provides traditional navigation and interaction methods for users who prefer or require a mouse.\n\nIn summary, this Creative Work is designed with a strong emphasis on accessibility, ensuring that it is usable by a wide range of individuals, including those with disabilities. The combination of accessibility features, hazard considerations, encoding formats, and control options highlights a commitment to inclusivity and user-friendly design.","prop":"accessibilityControl","example":"\"{\\\"@context\\\": \\\"https:\/\/schema.org\/\\\", \\\"@type\\\": \\\"CreativeWork\\\", \\\"accessibilityHazard\\\": [\\\"FlashingHazard\\\", \\\"noSoundHazard\\\", \\\"noMotionSimulationHazard\\\"], \\\"accessibilityFeature\\\": [\\\"alternativeText\\\", \\\"longDescription\\\"], \\\"encodingFormat\\\": [\\\"text\/html\\\", \\\"image\/png\\\", \\\"text\/javascript\\\", \\\"text\/css\\\"], \\\"accessibilityAPI\\\": [\\\"ARIA\\\", \\\"UIA\\\"], \\\"accessibilityControl\\\": [\\\"fullKeyboardControl\\\", \\\"fullTouchControl\\\", \\\"fullVoiceControl\\\", \\\"fullMouseControl\\\"]}\"","example_snippet":"{\"accessibilityControl\": \"text\/css\"}","explain":["expect accessibilityControl, got encodingFormat"]}

{"ref":"The provided JSON-LD markup describes a Creative Work with various accessibility features, hazards, and encoding formats. This document aims to elaborate on the details contained within the markup.\n\nThe Creative Work is designed with accessibility in mind, addressing potential hazards and incorporating features to enhance usability for individuals with disabilities. The work acknowledges three specific accessibility hazards: \"FlashingHazard,\" \"noSoundHazard,\" and \"noMotionSimulationHazard.\" The \"FlashingHazard\" indicates that the work may contain flashing content, which could be a concern for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy. The \"noSoundHazard\" suggests that the work does not rely on sound, making it accessible to those with hearing impairments. Similarly, the \"noMotionSimulationHazard\" implies that the work does not include motion simulation, which can be beneficial for users who experience motion sickness or have vestibular disorders.\n\nTo further support accessibility, the Creative Work includes several accessibility features. It provides \"alternativeText,\" which is essential for users who rely on screen readers, as it offers text descriptions for images. Additionally, the work includes a \"longDescription,\" providing detailed explanations of content, which can be particularly useful for complex images or diagrams.\n\nThe work is available in multiple encoding formats, ensuring compatibility with various technologies and user preferences. These formats include \"text\/html,\" which is the standard markup language for creating web pages; \"image\/png,\" a widely used image format; \"text\/javascript,\" a programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers; and \"text\/css,\" which is used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.\n\nIn terms of accessibility APIs, the Creative Work supports both \"ARIA\" (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) and \"UIA\" (User Interface Automation). ARIA is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. UIA is a Microsoft accessibility framework that enables assistive technology products to interact with user interface elements.\n\nThe work also offers comprehensive accessibility controls, ensuring that users can interact with it using their preferred input methods. It supports \"fullKeyboardControl,\" allowing users to navigate and interact with the content using a keyboard. \"FullTouchControl\" is available for users who prefer touch-based interaction, while \"fullVoiceControl\" enables voice commands for those who use voice recognition software. Lastly, \"fullMouseControl\" ensures that users can operate the work using a mouse.\n\nIn summary, this Creative Work is thoughtfully designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, incorporating features and controls that accommodate various needs and preferences.
